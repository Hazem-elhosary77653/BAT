## 💡 CRITICAL DECISIONS

### Timeline
- **4 weeks** (intensive) vs. **6-8 weeks** (moderate)
- ⚠️ Recommend: 4 weeks with 2-3 dedicated developers

### AI Model
- **GPT-4** (best quality, high cost) vs. **GPT-3.5-Turbo** (good quality, low cost)
- ⚠️ Recommend: GPT-3.5-Turbo initially, upgrade as needed

### Database
- **SQLite** (current) vs. **PostgreSQL** (production)
- ⚠️ Recommend: Migrate to PostgreSQL before production

### Deployment
- **Incremental** (feature by feature) vs. **Weekly** vs. **All at once**
- ⚠️ Recommend: Weekly to get feedback faster
